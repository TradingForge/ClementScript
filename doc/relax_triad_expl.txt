I also noticed that only ~33% of matches have a valid triad with the current rule. To improve coverage, could we support two modes:



1. Exact triad (current rule)
- Window: [+52; +60] minutes from scheduled kickoff
- Sync: max 60s between 1 / X / 2
- Pick the latest triad in the window
2. Relaxed triad (fallback if no exact triad found)
- Tighter window: [+54; +60]
- Sync: max 180s between 1 / X / 2
- Selection priority:
1. Choose the triad with the smallest max gap between the three timestamps
2. If tied, pick the one closest to +60:00.



Please add a column to the output indicating which rule was used per match:
- ht_selection_method = exact, relaxed, or none (if still nothing, keep the HT odds empty as agreed)

- Exact triad (primary): window +52 to +60, max 60s between 1/X/2, pick the latest triad.
- Relaxed triad (backup only): use only if no exact triad exists. Window +54 to +60, max 180s between 1/X/2. Selection priority: smallest max gap, then closest to +60:00.



So to be clear: relaxed is just a fallback to increase coverage when exact is not available.

Small schema note: please add only one column

ht_selection_method = exact, relaxed, or none.
- If the criteria are met with Exact or Relaxed, the odds go into the same HT columns Home odd HT, Draw odd HT, Away odd HT).
- If ht_selection_method = none, keep those three HT odds empty.

in settingscfg there are 
relaxed_time_from=54
relaxed_time_to=60
relaxed_window_secs=180

use them  for  relax triad
